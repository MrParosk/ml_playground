# Generative models

Implementation of common deep generative models (for images). They are tested on the MNIST data set, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/).

The models are:

- [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) 
- [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
- [VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)
- [Conditional VAE](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generative-models)
- [VQ VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937)
